# fitanketa-miner
Script for mining the FIT CTU course pass percentages

## Usage
When run, the script connects to https://anketa.cvut.cz/stav/stav_anketa_fit.html, parses its contents and appends the 
information to the `courses.json` file. The file has following structure:

```json
{
  "1496326146": {
    "BI-ACM2": {
      "department": 18101,
      "course_id": "BI-ACM2",
      "course_name": "Programovac√≠ praktika",
      "enrolled": 36,
      "finished": 35,
      "submitted_survey": 0,
      "percent_finished": 0.9722222222222222
    },
    "BI-AG2": {
      "department": 18101,
      "course_id": "BI-AG2",
      "course_name": "Algoritmy a grafy 2",
      "enrolled": 82,
      "finished": 10,
      "submitted_survey": 0,
      "percent_finished": 0.12195121951219512
    }
  },
  "1496326158":{
    
  }
}
```

The keys in the dict are UTC timestamps of the associated data. The rest is pretty self-explanatory.
